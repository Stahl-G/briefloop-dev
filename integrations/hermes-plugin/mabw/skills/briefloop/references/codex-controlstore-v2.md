# Codex ControlStore v2 Runtime

This is the executable protocol for a fresh BriefLoop workspace whose selected
runtime is `codex`. SQLite receipts and ledger relations are the sole authority.

## 1. Install And Enter The Runtime

Install the packaged workspace-local Codex kit when it is absent:

```bash
briefloop runtime install --workspace <workspace> --runtime codex
```

The installed `.codex/` tree is part of the frozen runtime identity. `run` and
every `runtime` command hash the actual workspace-local config, Skill,
reference, and all role files and compare them with the Store binding. A
missing, extra, replaced, symlinked, or edited kit file fails closed with
`runtime_adapter_binding_mismatch`; reinstalling is not permission to mutate an
already initialized run.

Open and trust the workspace in Codex so its project `.codex/config.toml`,
skill, and exact role agents load. Start or reopen the run with:

```bash
briefloop run --workspace <workspace> --runtime codex
```

The command emits one strict `CoreRunNextAction`. It does not emit a legacy
handoff and does not authorize work beyond that action.

The kit written during init is verified Store-bound adapter material for
reopened/future sessions. It does not hot-load itself into a Codex process that
was already running. An already-active controller that invoked `init --web`
continues using the protocol it already loaded.

### Authorized local continuation

When the Store contains the M2 `RunExecutionAuthorization` for
`completion_target=finalized_local`, use:

```bash
briefloop runtime continue --workspace <workspace>
```

The command re-verifies Store and a fresh action before every effect. It may
commit the parameter-free authorized source pack and other existing
deterministic effects. `role_work_required` names the exact envelope whose
scratch proposal the current session must produce; call the command again
after proposal validation. `proposal_invalid`, `needs_human`, and
`needs_attention` are stop/attention results. `finalized_local` is terminal and
never implies approval, packaging, delivery, or repair. Runs without the
authorization retain the granular protocol below and receive a zero-write
unsupported/manual result from `runtime continue`.

## 2. Snapshot The Exact Action

Before executing an action, write the exact command output to a regular file
inside the workspace. A safe refresh pattern is:

```bash
briefloop runtime next --workspace <workspace> \
  > <workspace>/runtime_action.next.json \
  && mv <workspace>/runtime_action.next.json \
        <workspace>/runtime_action.json
```

Pass that exact file to `invocation-start` or `apply`. The file is an
untrusted snapshot, not authority; the runtime re-verifies every field against
the current Store. If it returns `runtime_action_stale`, stop, preserve any
already-recorded invocation result, fetch a fresh action, and do not retry the
old action.

Never edit an action JSON, copy selected fields into a new object, or infer the
next action from a transaction result, projection, filename, prompt, or memory.

## 3. Dispatch By `action_kind`

Exactly five action kinds exist.

### `delegate`

1. Start the exact action:

   ```bash
   briefloop runtime invocation-start --workspace <workspace> \
     --action <workspace>/runtime_action.json
   ```

2. Read the host-materialized
   `scratch/<invocation_id>/role_task_envelope.json`. The
   `RoleTaskEnvelope` fixes the role, stage, action fingerprint, context mode,
   dispatch instruction, scratch directory, allowed filenames, and proposal
   schema.
3. Obey `dispatch_instruction` exactly:
   - `execute_in_current_session`: the current Codex session performs only the
     named role task.
   - `delegate_exact_role`: invoke only the exact installed Codex role named by
     `role_id` and give it the envelope. Do not let root substitute for it.
   - `use_declared_route`: use only the declared existing route.
4. The executing role writes only the permitted proposal files under its own
   `scratch_directory`. For a strict JSON proposal, its `task_instructions`
   include two binding, read-only preflight commands:

   ```bash
   briefloop contract show <proposal_schema_id> --example full
   briefloop runtime invocation-validate --workspace <workspace> \
     --envelope <workspace>/scratch/<invocation_id>/role_task_envelope.json
   ```

   Run the first before writing and the second after writing. Continue only
   when validation returns `status=valid`; never guess a wrapper, alias, or
   field or invocation binding. These commands inspect the exact envelope and
   proposal bytes only and never write the Store. Other runtime commands remain
   root-host-only. The role must not write the Store or canonical artifacts.
5. When the proposal is complete, the root host accepts it through:

   ```bash
   briefloop runtime invocation-accept --workspace <workspace> \
     --envelope <workspace>/scratch/<invocation_id>/role_task_envelope.json
   ```

6. If execution cannot produce a valid proposal, record exactly one allowed
   failure reason:

   ```bash
   briefloop runtime invocation-fail --workspace <workspace> \
     --envelope <workspace>/scratch/<invocation_id>/role_task_envelope.json \
     --reason <allowed-reason>
   ```

   Allowed reasons are `dispatch_unavailable`, `child_failed`,
   `child_timed_out`, `session_interrupted`, `proposal_missing`, and
   `proposal_invalid`. Do not place private text, paths, or model output in a
   reason.

If an invocation is already active and the current action says
`effect_kind=invocation_accept_or_fail`, either accept through the exact
envelope as above or apply the exact current action. `runtime apply` performs
the same envelope-bound preflight and accepts only a valid proposal; an invalid
proposal fails with zero Store writes. Use explicit `invocation-fail` when the
role cannot produce a valid proposal. `invocation-start` without `--action` may
only recover that exact active envelope; it is not permission to start another
role.

### `deterministic`

Apply the exact action through the root host:

```bash
briefloop runtime apply --workspace <workspace> \
  --action <workspace>/runtime_action.json
```

The host derives the strict transaction request from verified Store state. Do
not make a role perform a deterministic effect. The sole extra input is for an
`artifact_supersede` action: supply the exact strict
`briefloop.runtime_repair_content_input.v2` through `--action-input`. Do not
invent another repair or content path.

`source_acquire` is also a deterministic `runtime apply` action. Its internal
provider invocation does not turn search snippets into evidence and does not
authorize a specialist to bypass source eligibility.

### `human_decision`

Stop for the human decision identified by `request_schema_id`. A chat reply is
not the request. Materialize one complete strict request inside the workspace,
show its consequential fields to the human, obtain explicit confirmation, then
run:

```bash
briefloop runtime apply --workspace <workspace> \
  --action <workspace>/runtime_action.json \
  --human-request <workspace>/<strict-request>.json
```

The human source request is
`briefloop.runtime_human_source_pack_request.v2`: one ordered list of 1–256
members plus the workspace-relative frozen source manifest and its exact
SHA-256. Every member must exactly match the manifest source id, URL, title,
publisher, content hash, and either `published_at` or the
`status_incident/opened_at` temporal shape. The host validates the complete
manifest and pack before starting its invocation, then commits every accepted
source in one UoW and one Receipt. A missing, changed, duplicate, reordered, or
mismatched member rejects the whole pack with zero partial source registration.
Do not submit the files one at a time when they are one frozen
experimental/source pack.

Other current strict request families cover internal approval and delivery
authorization/reconciliation. Do not guess Store revision, run id, hashes,
decision vocabulary, or authorization scope. Missing or mismatched requests
fail closed.

### `blocked`

Do not delegate, apply, edit files to hide the block, or choose a fallback.
Report the exact `effect_kind`, `reason_code`, stage, Store revision, and action
fingerprint. Use `briefloop runtime diagnose --workspace <workspace>` only for
read-only typed diagnosis.

### `complete`

Do not apply or delegate. Report the exact terminal effect:

- `effect_kind=package_ready`: the local delivery package is ready; delivery
  has not succeeded.
- `effect_kind=delivered`: the recorded delivery succeeded.

File existence, HTML, Quality Panel, checkout bytes, or a prior delivery event
cannot upgrade `package_ready` to `delivered`.

## 4. Refresh And Continue

`invocation-accept`, `invocation-fail`, and `runtime apply` return a typed result
that includes `next_action`. Treat it as a convenience view, then refresh and
snapshot the exact current action with `runtime next` before the next mutation.
Repeat until the action is `blocked`, `human_decision`, or `complete`.

## 5. Authority And Isolation

- Never edit `briefloop.db`, SQL, receipts, ledger records, invocation records,
  frozen artifacts, or canonical artifact revisions.
- Never write another invocation's scratch or any filename absent from
  `allowed_output_filenames`.
- JSON, JSONL, Markdown, HTML, status, handoff, finalize, Quality Panel, and
  checkout files are projections only. Never read them back for legality.
- A JSON-only workspace is unsupported. Do not migrate, import, dual-read,
  dual-write, or fall back to it.
- Do not use `operator`, `start`, `--skip-doctor`, legacy state/gate/repair/
  finalize/delivery commands, or another runtime as a recovery path.
- `role_topology=single_session` is one shared Codex context with separate
  Receipt-backed invocations and stage-separated self-review. It is not
  independent review. Future-stage drafting before its invocation is forbidden.
- Role envelopes constrain writes, not arbitrary local reads. For blinded A2
  experiments, place the workspace and its allowed inputs under an isolated
  directory whose parents do not contain the risk ledger, A0/A1 outputs, or
  scoring files; optionally run `briefloop experiments a2-isolation-preflight`.
  Report this honestly as procedural isolation, never as an OS sandbox.
